Soil Sampling and Monitoring:

Problem Statement: Soil sampling is a crucial aspect of soil health monitoring, as it provides essential information about the soil's physical, chemical, and biological properties. Traditional soil sampling methods are manual, time-consuming, and often result in inconsistent and unreliable data. The need for a more efficient and accurate soil sampling system is crucial in ensuring sustainable agriculture and food security.

Objective: To develop an loT-based soil sampling system that can accurately and efficiently collect soil samples, analyze the soil data in real-time, and provide actionable insights to farmers and agriculture experts. The system should also be scalable, flexible, and adaptable to different soil types and climates.

Scope: The loT-based soil sampling system will consist of smart soil sampling devices equipped with loT sensors, a cloud-based platform for data storage and analysis, and a mobile application for real time monitoring and management of soil health parameters. The system should be easy to install, operate, and maintain, and should provide consistent and reliable data on soil health parameters such as pH, temperature, moisture, and nutrient levels.

Deliverables:The final solution will deliver a complete loT-based soil sampling system that includes the following components:
Smart soil sampling devices equipped with loT sensors
Cloud-based platform for data storage and analysis
Mobile application for real-time monitoring and management of soil health parameters
Integration and testing of the complete system in a real-world agriculture setting
