* This Capacitive soil moisture sensor measures the volumetric content of water inside the soil and gives us the moisture level as output.  It is made of corrosion-resistant material, providing excellent service life.
This module has an operating voltage range of 3.3 ~ 5.5V. It supports a 3-pin interface, i.e., Input Voltage, Ground, and Output pin.

### 2. A pH sensor

* This analog pH Sensor Kit is specially designed for microcontrollers. It has an LED that works as the Power Indicator, a BNC connector, and a PH2.0 sensor interface. To use it, we connected the pH sensor with the BND connector and plugged the PH2.0 interface into the analog input port of our microcontroller.

### 3. A temperature sensor

* The thermistor is a temperature sensor that uses a semiconductor and measures the temperature and sends this information in terms of resistance value. It is able to record the slightest temperature changes.

* The ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip with built-in TCP/IP networking software and microcontroller capability.The ESP8266 WiFi Module is a self-contained SOC with an integrated TCP/IP protocol stack that can give any microcontroller access to your WiFi network. The ESP8266 can host an application or offload all WiFi networking functions from another processor. Each ESP8266 module comes pre-programmed with an AT command set firmware, meaning we can simply hook this up to our Arduino device and get about as much WiFi-ability as a WiFi Shield offers. It has 17 GPIO pins, a serial peripheral interface bus(SPI), and a 10-bit ADC, making it easy to use.
