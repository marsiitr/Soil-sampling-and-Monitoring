#### Overview

* Soil sampling is a crucial aspect of soil health monitoring, as it provides essential information about the soil's physical, chemical, and biological properties. Traditional soil sampling methods are manual, time-consuming, and often result in inconsistent and unreliable data. The need for a more efficient and accurate soil sampling system is crucial in ensuring sustainable agriculture and food security.

### Our work

* We have developed an IoT-based soil sampling system that can accurately and efficiently collect soil samples, analyze the soil in real-time, and gives various parameters like moisture content, pH value, and temperature of soil so that people can choose the best soil for farming.

* We've used these sensors in the project:
  1. Capacitive Moisture sensor
  2. pH sensor
  3. Temperature sensor

* A NodeMCU Esp8266 is used to store the code.

* The code is available at : [Code](Code)

* The details can be found at : 
  [Equipments Description](Description/EquipmentsDescription.md)

### Circuit diagram

* We've  designed the circuit of this model as :

### CAD Model

* The model is kept inside a box which is basically a CAD Model.
* The designs can be found at :

### Result

* As the project ended,we’ve been able to get data from the sensors, and using IoT, we’re sending that data to the cloud successfully. That data is easily available on our device using the Blynk IoT platform.

* So this can be used from far locations as well as it uses  wi-fi which makes it handy its interface is also very easy to use, so any newcomer can get accurate and necessary information about the soil very easily.
